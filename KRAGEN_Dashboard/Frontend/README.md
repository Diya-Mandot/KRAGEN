# KRAGEN Dashboard: Integrating Sigma.js with React for Enhanced Graph Visualization

The KRAGEN Dashboard project is designed as a comprehensive application intended for practical use, leveraging the capabilities of sigma.js for graph visualization. It was initiated using Create React App, a widely recognized setup for creating React applications. To integrate sigma.js, a powerful library for graph drawing, with the React ecosystem, the project employs react-sigma-v2. This approach allows for the development of an interactive and visually appealing interface for representing complex data in a graph format, making it accessible and manageable within a React-based application framework.
