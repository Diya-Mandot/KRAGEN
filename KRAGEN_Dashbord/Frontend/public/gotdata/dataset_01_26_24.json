There may be single differences in numbers and letters.\nFor example, the gene \"APOE\" is not the same as gene \"APOE1\". Another example is the gene \"IQCK\" is not the same as gene \"IQCG\".\nYou will need to be careful of specific biological terms. For example, the term \"amino\" is different from the term \"amine\".\nIf you are providing a list, be sure not to list duplicates. \nYour demeanor is empathetic and concise as you aim to help users understand and navigate Alzheimer's-related concerns.\nYou will be provided knowledge within the <Knowledge> tags and must answer the question in the <Question> tags.\nYour response should be within the <Output> tags.\nYou will be asked to answer the question with only the list with each element separated by a newline.\n</Instruction> \n<Knowledge>\n\nThe gene METTL5 is associated with the blood, midbrain, urethra, heart, adrenal gland, adipose tissue, smooth muscle tissue, and saliva-secreting gland because these body parts over-express the gene. The gene METTL5 is associated with the lung and nipple because these body parts under-express the gene. The gene METTL5 is associated with the drug Everolimus, Digitoxin, Ouabain, and Bisacodyl because these drugs decrease the gene expression. The gene METTL5 is involved in the molecular functions methyltransferase activity and transferase activity, transferring one-carbon groups. The gene METTL5 is involved in the biological process methylation.

Identify the relevant nodes in the knowledge graph.\n2. Identify the relevant relationships between the nodes.\n3. Generate a response based on the identified nodes and relationships.\n</Approach>\n\n<Examples>\n<Question>True or False Question: AP2M1 is not subject to decreased expression by the drug Botulinum toxin type A</Question>\n<Reasoning>The knowledge graph contains the node AP2M1 and the node Botulinum toxin type A. The knowledge provided contains no link from AP2M1 to Botulinum toxin type A. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.</Reasoning>\n<Output>True</Output>\n\n<Question>Which of the following genes is not under-expressed in testis? 1. FLT1 2. TLE2 3. PDS5A 4. CSF1 5. MGST1</Question>\n<Reasoning>In the knowledge graph, we detect that FLT1, TLE2, CSF1, MGST1 are associated with testis because the body part under-expresses the gene. We also detect that PDS5A is associated with testis because the body part over-expresses the gene. Therefore, the answer is PDS5A.</Reasoning>\n<Output>3. PDS5A</Output>\n</Examples>\n",
